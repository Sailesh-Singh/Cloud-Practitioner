#   [Getting Started with Compute](https://awseducate.instructure.com/courses/817)

##	Overview
When we consider running our workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), we will want to consider our compute options. AWS provides the services that we need to build the compute solution that’s right for our workload and our business. We will review the primary compute types and the differences between them. We will also learn how computing balances different amounts of compute, memory, storage, and networking to optimize for our use case.

We will then focus on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a secure and resizable compute service that offers reliable, scalable infrastructure on demand. Customers of all sizes and industries can use the broad range of instance choices from Amazon EC2 to match their workloads’ needs. We will learn about the types of instances to meet our use case. These instance types include general purpose, compute optimized, memory optimized, storage optimized, and accelerated computing. 

In this course, we acquire the knowledge that we need to start using Amazon EC2. We will learn about the key concepts and features of Amazon EC2. We will learn how to launch and configure an instance to meet our workload’s needs. We will choose storage for our compute instance and configure security to keep our data secure.  


##	Objectives
By the end of this course, we will be able to do the following:

+   Discuss different types of compute solutions and their features and benefits.
+   Discuss the basic features and concepts of Amazon EC2.
+   Describe EC2 instance types and how to choose an instance type.
+   Describe how to use Amazon EC2 to launch and configure an instance.
+   Describe how to manage EC2 instances.
+   Use Amazon EC2 to launch and manage and instance.
