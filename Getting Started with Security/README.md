#   [Getting Started with Security](https://awseducate.instructure.com/courses/890)

##	Overview
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. IAM enables you to securely manage access to AWS offerings and resources. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. IAM is a feature of your AWS account thatâ€™s offered at no additional charge. You will be charged only for use of other AWS services by your users.
