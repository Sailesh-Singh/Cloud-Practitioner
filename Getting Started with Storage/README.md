#   Getting Started with Storage

## Overview

When you consider running your workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), you might first consider your storage options. AWS storage provides the services that you need to build the storage solution thatâ€™s right for your business. You will review the primary storage types and the differences between them. You will also learn how to identify the right solution in the cloud based on your requirements. 

You will then focus on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.  Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases. These use cases include websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and big data analytics. 

In this course, you acquire the knowledge that you need to start using Amazon S3. You learn about the key elements of Amazon S3 and explore how to configure them. You learn how to upload data to Amazon S3 and what additional AWS services you can use to transfer data to Amazon S3 at scale. You also learn the basic elements of security within Amazon S3.
