#   Getting Started with Storage

## Overview

When you consider running your workloads on Amazon Web Services (AWS), you might first consider your storage options. AWS storage provides the services that you need to build the storage solution thatâ€™s right for your business. You will review the primary storage types and the differences between them. You will also learn how to identify the right solution in the cloud based on your requirements. 

You will then focus on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.  Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases. These use cases include websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and big data analytics. 

In this course, you acquire the knowledge that you need to start using Amazon S3. You learn about the key elements of Amazon S3 and explore how to configure them. You learn how to upload data to Amazon S3 and what additional AWS services you can use to transfer data to Amazon S3 at scale. You also learn the basic elements of security within Amazon S3.

##  Objectives

### Introduction to Storage
+   #### Introduction to Storage

    Computers use data to complete tasks, and this data must be stored to be accessed. Some data can be stored internal to the computer itself, such as files that help the computer start up and run. More data can be stored on servers to be accessed by our computer. When data is on server in the cloud, people  all around the world can access it. 

    [<img src="assets/Introduction-to-storage.png" alt="Introduction-to-storage" align="left" width="100%" height="100%">]()
    <small>**_Introduction to Storage_**</small>

    There are different types of storage for different applications. Before learning about the types of cloud storage, it is important to understand the difference between **_On-premises storage and Cloud storage_**

    <p align="center">
    <small><strong><i>Benefits of Cloud Storage</i></strong></small>
    </p>


    <b>1.  Cost Efficient</b> so we pay for only what we use.

    <b>2.  Secure</b> because data is saved across multiple servers.

    <b>3.  Accessible</b> to multiple users in an account.

    <b>4.  Scalable</b> so it can grow and shrink as our workloads change.

    <b>5.  Managed</b> so we don't have to worry about servers, and we can focus on our data and applications.

    <b>6.  Backed up</b> so copies of data are stored in different physical locations in case of failure.

+   ####    Types of Cloud Storage

    [<img src="assets/Types_of_cloud-storage.png" alt="    Types_of_cloud-storage" align="center" width="100%" height="100%">]()
    <p align="center">
    <small><strong><i>Types of Cloud Storage</i></strong></small>
    </p>

    Storage comes in three basic types: <b>block storage, file storage, and object storage</b>.

    #####   1.   Block Storage

    [<img src="assets/Block_storage.png" alt="Types_of_cloud-storage" align="left" width="90px" height="90px">]()

    Block storage breaks up data into blocks and then stores those blocks as separate pieces, each with a unique identifier. They are stored wherever it is most efficient. Thus, it can store those blocks across different systems and each block can be configured to work with different operating systems.
    
    <br>

    #####   2.   Cloud Storage

    [<img src="assets/File_storage.png" alt="File_storage" align="right" width="500px" height="150px">]()
    File storage is a methodology that helps users, applications, and services access data in a shared file system. Data is stored in a hierarchical structure. This structure is similar to a centralized shared network drive in a company where employees store and access file.

    <br>

    #####   3.   Object Storage

    [<img src="assets/Object_storage.png" alt="File_storage" align="right" width="100%" height="110px">]()

    In Object storage, files are stored as objects based on attributes and metadata. Each object consists of data, metadata, and an object key. The metadata has information about the data (object size, object purpose, and more), and the object key is the unique identifier of the object. When you update files in object storage, the entire file object is updated, instead of a piece of a file, as in block storage.

+   ####    Storage use cases

    [<img src="assets/Storage_use_cases.png" alt="Storage_use_cases" align="left" width="40px" height="50px">]()

    Storage use cases gives ideas for how to solve storage problems that we might face. We will discuss about two use cases:  

    #####   1.   Block storage use cases

     [<img src="assets/Block_and_its_types.png" alt="Block_and_its_types" align="center" width="100%" height="100%">]()
    <p align="center">
    <small><strong><i>Block storage and its types</i></strong></small>
    </p>

    ######  Hosting database instances
    Block storage scales with your performance needs, whether you are supporting millions of gaming customers or billions of e-commerce transactions. Databases such as SAP HANA, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL are widely deployed on block storage.
    Block storage volumes provide consistent and low-latency performance for running NoSQL databases such as Cassandra, MongoDB, and CouchDB.

    ######  Big data analytics
    Block storage offers data persistence, dynamic-performance adjustments, and the ability to detach and reattach volumes. Therefore, you can resize clusters for big data analytics engines such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.
    Block storage provides persistent, fast storage to address key components of your solution, including data warehouses, search and indexing, NoSQL databases, and streaming data.

    ######  Enterprise applications
    Block storage provides high availability and high durability storage to reliably run mission-critical applications on AWS.
    The design of block storage provides versatile storage services with:
    +   Low latency and consistently high input/output operations per second (IOPS) and throughput performance
    +   Capacity and performance scalability without workload disruption
    +   High availability

    #####   2.   Object storage use cases

    <p align="center">
    <small><strong><i>Object storage and its types</i></strong></small>
    </p>

    ######  Disaster recovery
    Protect critical data, applications, and IT systems that run in the AWS Cloud or your on-premises environment without incurring the expense of a second physical site. With object storage and other cloud services, you can create disaster recovery architectures to recover from outages caused by natural disasters, system failures, and human errors.

    ######  Data lakes
    Accelerate innovation by building a data lake with object storage. You can then extract valuable insights using query- in-place, analytics, and machine learning tools.
    You can also store large amounts of data that you only need to access periodically. For instance, suppose that your business does a lot of production work, in any medium. You probably need a lot of space to store your finished projects after their useful life is complete. However, you probably also need access to the files in case you or a client needs them again in the future.

    ######  Cloud-native applications
    Build fast, cost-effective cloud-native applications by using object storage to store development and production data. The microservices that make up cloud-native applications share this data. With object storage, you can upload any amount of data and access it anywhere to deploy applications faster and reach more users.

+   ####	AWS core storage services
    +   #####   Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)

        [<img src="assets/Amazon(EBS).png" alt="Amazon(EBS)" align="right" width="90px" height="90px">]()

        Amazon EBS is a scalable, high-performance block-storage service designed for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). You can use Amazon EBS to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2 instances. All EBS volume types offer durable snapshot capabilities and are designed for 99.999 percent availability. Amazon EBS provides a range of options that you can choose from to optimize storage performance and cost for your workload.

    </p>

+   ####    Meet Amazon S3

    Amazon S3 is an object storage service that you can use to collect, store, and analyze data in any amount from anywhere in the world. Amazon S3 is available to businesses of all sizes and in any industry for a range of use cases.

    Common use cases include:
    +	<b>Data lakes</b>, for storing large amounts of data
    +	<b>File storage</b>, for static website hosting
    +	<b>Backups</b> of data, for use in disaster recovery
    +	<b>Archive</b>, for data that isn't being actively used but saved for the future.
    
    Amazon S3 offers high levels of <b>scalability, data durability and availability, perfomance, and security</b>.

+   ####    Basic S3 workflow

    First, we move our data into  Amazon S3. It accepts data of all file types. Although there is no limit to the amount of data that can be stored, individual objects must be less than 5 terabytes (TB).

    The data is stored as objects in an S3 bucket. Each object has a unique identifier.

    Using the unique identifier, we can use the objects in applications or to analyze data.

    [<img src="assets/Basic_S3-workflow.png" alt="Basic_S3-workflow" align="center" width="100%" height="100%">]()
    <p align="center">
    <small><strong><i>Basic S3 Workflow</i></strong></small>

+   ####    Object-level storage

    [<img src="assets/Object-level_storage.png" alt="Object-level_storage" align="center" width="100%" height="100%">]()
    <p align="center">
    <small><strong><i>Object-level storage</i></strong></small>
    </p>

    The files, or objects, that you upload to Amazon S3 consist of data and metadata. The metadata consists of information about the data, such as content type, last modified date, and more. In addition to the data and metadata, an object's key serves as a unique identifier.
    S3 buckets are created inside regions. Objects are stored in a bucket, which is similar to a directory or folder in your computer. When you store  an object in a bucket, the combination of a bucket name, key, and version ID uniquely identifies the object  so that you can interact with that object.

+   ####    Active and archive storage

    [<img src="assets/Active_and_archive_storage.png" alt="Active_and_archive_storage" align="center" width="100%" height="100%">]()
    <p align="center">
    <small><strong><i>Active and archive storage</i></strong></small>
    </p>

    Object storage can be classified by how often you must access your data. The two broad categories are active storage and archive storage. 

    Active storage is for the data you use all the time. It also includes data that you access less frequently, but itis important that data can be accessed quickly. Examplesare files for a static website or backups.

    Archive storage is for data that you rarely access but must be maintained. Examples could include data for compliance or business continuity operations.

+   ####    Amazon S3 storage classes
