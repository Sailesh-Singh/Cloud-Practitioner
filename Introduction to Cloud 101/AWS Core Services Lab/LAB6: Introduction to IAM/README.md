+   Inspecting  IAM policies  as applied to the pre-created groups 
+   Following a  real-world scenario , adding users to groups with specific capabilities enabled 
+   Locating and using the  IAM sign-in URL 
+   Experimenting  with the effects of policies on service access

####   Duration
This lab requires approximately  40 minutes  to complete.

####    Task 1: Explore the users and groups

In this task, you will explore the users and groups that have already been created for you in IAM. 

+   First, note the Region that you are in; for example,  N. Virginia . The Region is displayed in the upper-right corner of the console page.  

+   Choose the  Services  menu, locate the  Security, Identity, & Compliance  services, and choose  IAM . 

+   In the navigation pane on the left, choose  Users . 

    The following IAM users have been created for you: 
    +   user-1 
    +   user-2 
    +   user-3 

+   Choose the name of  user-1 . 
    +   This brings you to a summary page for user-1. The  Permissions  tab will be displayed. 
    +   Notice that user-1 does not have any permissions. 

+   Choose the  Groups  tab. 

    Notice that user-1 also is not a member of any groups. 

+   Choose the  Security credentials  tab. 

    Notice that user-1 is assigned a  Console password . This allows the user to access the AWS Management Console. 

+   In the navigation pane on the left, choose  User groups . 

    The following groups have already been created for you: 
    +   EC2-Admin 
    +   EC2-Support 
    +   S3-Support 

+   Choose the name of the  EC2-Support  group. 

    This brings you to the summary page for the  EC2-Support  group. 

+   Choose the  Permissions  tab. 

    This group has a managed policy called  AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess  associated with it. Managed policies are prebuilt policies (built either by AWS or by your administrators) that can be attached to IAM users and groups. When the policy is updated, the changes to the policy are immediately applied against all users and groups that are attached to the policy. 

+   Under  Policy Name , choose the link for the  AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess  policy. 

+   Choose the  {} JSON  tab. 

    +   A policy defines what actions are allowed or denied for specific AWS resources. This policy is granting permission to  List  and  Describe  (view) information about Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. This ability to view resources, but not modify them, is ideal for assigning to a support role. 

    +   Statements in an IAM policy have the following basic structure: 
        +   Effect  says whether to  Allow  or  Deny  the permissions. 

        +   Action  specifies the API calls that can be made against an AWS service (for example,  cloudwatch:ListMetrics ). 

        +   Resource  defines the scope of entities covered by the policy rule (for example, a specific Amazon Simple Storage Service [Amazon S3] bucket or Amazon EC2 instance; an asterisk [ * ] means  any resource ). 

+   In the navigation pane on the left, choose  User groups . 

+   Choose the name of the  S3-Support  group. 

+   Choose the  Permissions  tab. 

    The S3-Support group has the  AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess  policy attached. 

+   Under  Policy Name , choose the link for the  AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess  policy. 

+   Choose the  {} JSON  tab. 

    This policy has permissions to  Get  and  List  for  all  resources in Amazon S3. 

+   In the navigation pane on the left, choose  User groups . 

+   Choose the name of the  EC2-Admin  group. 

+   Choose the  Permissions  tab. 

    This group is different from the other two. Instead of a managed policy, the group has an  inline policy , which is a policy assigned to just one user or group. Inline policies are typically used to apply permissions for specific situations. 

+   Under  Policy Name , choose the name of the  EC2-Admin-Policy  policy. 

+   Choose the  JSON  tab. 

    This policy grants permission to  Describe  information about Amazon EC2 instances, and also the ability to  Start  and  Stop  instances. 

+   At the bottom of the screen, choose  Cancel  to close the policy.

####    Business scenario

For the remainder of this lab, you will work with these users and groups to enable permissions that support the following business scenario. 

Your company is growing its use of AWS services, and is using many Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon S3 buckets. You want to give access to new staff depending upon their job function, as indicated in the following table: 

<table>

<th>User</th>
<th>In Group</th>
<th>Permissions</th>

<tr>
    <td>user-1</td>
    <td>S3-Support </td>
    <td>Read-only access to Amazon S3</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>user-2</td>
    <td>EC2-Support</td>
    <td>Read-only access to Amazon EC2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>user-3</td>
    <td>EC2-Admin</td>
    <td>View, Start, and Stop Amazon EC2 instances</td>
</tr>

</table>

####    Task 2: Add users to groups

You have recently hired  user-1  into a role where they will provide support for Amazon S3. You will add them to the  S3-Support  group so that they inherit the necessary permissions via the attached  AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess  policy. 

Ignore any "not authorized" errors that appear during this task. They are caused by your lab account having limited permissions and will not impact your ability to complete the lab.

#####   Add user-1 to the S3-Support group

+   In the left navigation pane, choose  User groups . 
+   Choose the name of the  S3-Support  group. 
+   On the  Users  tab, choose  Add users . 
+   Select   user-1 , and choose  Add users . 
    On the  Users  tab, notice that  user-1  has been added to the group. 

#####   Add user-2 to the EC2-Support group

You have hired  user-2  into a role where they will provide support for Amazon EC2. You will add them to the  EC2-Support  group so that they inherit the necessary permissions via the attached  AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess  policy. 

+   Use what you learned from the previous steps to add  user-2  to the  EC2-Support  group. 

    user-2  should now be part of the  EC2-Support  group. 

#####   Add user-3 to the EC2-Admin group

You have hired  user-3  as your Amazon EC2 administrator to manage your EC2 instances. You will add them to the  EC2-Admin  group so that they inherit the necessary permissions via the attached  EC2-Admin-Policy . 

+   Use what you learned from the previous steps to add  user-3  to the  EC2-Admin  group. 

    user-3  should now be part of the  EC2-Admin  group. 

+   In the navigation pane on the left, choose  User groups . 

    Each group should have a  1  in the  Users  column. This indicates the number of users in each group. 

    If you do not have a  1  for the  Users  column for a group, revisit the previous steps to ensure that each user is assigned to a group, as shown in the table in the  Business scenario  section. 

####    Task 3: Sign in and test users 

In this task, you will test the permissions of each IAM user in the console. 
#####   Get the console sign-in URL

+   In the navigation pane on the left, choose  Dashboard . 

    >Notice the  Sign-in URL for IAM users in this account  section at the top of the page. The sign-in URL looks similar to the following:  https : //123456789012.signin.aws.amazon.com/console 
    This link can be used to sign in to the AWS account that you are currently using. 

+   Copy the sign-in link to a text editor. 

#####   Test user-1 permissions

+   Open a private or incognito window in your browser. 

+   Paste the sign-in link into the private browser, and press ENTER. 

    You will now sign-in as  user-1 , who has been hired as your Amazon S3 storage support staff. 

+   Sign in with the following credentials: 
    +   IAM user name:  user-1
    +   Password:  Lab-Password1

+   Choose the  Services  menu, and choose  S3. 

+   Choose the name of one of your buckets, and browse the contents. 

    Because this user is part of the  S3-Support  group in IAM, they have permissions to view a list of Amazon S3 buckets and their contents. 

    Now, test whether the user has access to Amazon EC2. 

+   Choose the  Services  menu, and choose  EC2 . 

+   In the left navigation pane, choose  Instances . 

    You cannot see any instances. Instead, an error message says  you are not authorized to perform this operation . This user has not been assigned any permissions to use Amazon EC2. 

    You will now sign in as  user-2 , who has been hired as your Amazon EC2 support person. 

+   First, sign out  user-1  from the console: 
    +   In the upper-right corner of the page, choose  user-1 . 
    +   Choose  Sign Out . 

#####   Test user-2 permissions

+   Paste the sign-in link into the private browser again, and press ENTER. 

+   Sign in with the following credentials: 
    +   IAM user name:  `user-2`
    +   Password:  `Lab-Password2`

+   Choose the  Services  menu, and choose  EC2 . 

+   In the navigation pane on the left, choose  Instances . 
    +   You are now able to see an EC2 instance. However, you cannot make any changes to Amazon EC2 resources because you have read-only permissions. 
    +   If you cannot see an EC2 instance, then your Region might be incorrect. In the upper-right corner of the page, choose the Region name, and then choose the Region that you were in at the beginning of the lab (for example,  N. Virginia ). 

+   Select the EC2 instance. 

+   Choose the  Instance state  menu, and then choose  Stop instance . 

+   To confirm that you want to stop the instance, choose  Stop . 

    An error message appears and says that  You are not authorized to perform this operation . This demonstrates that the policy only allows you to view information without making changes. 

    Next, check if  user-2  can access Amazon S3. 

+   Choose the  Services  menu, and choose  S3 . 

    An error message says  You don't have permissions to list buckets  because  user-2  does not have permissions to use Amazon S3. 

    You will now sign-in as  user-3 , who has been hired as your Amazon EC2 administrator. 

+   First, sign out  user-2  from the console: 
    +   In the upper-right corner of the page, choose  user-2 . 
    +   Choose  Sign Out . 

#####   Test user-3 permissions

+   Paste the sign-in link into the private browser again, and press ENTER. 

+   Sign in with the following credentials: 
    +   IAM user name:  `user-3`
    +   Password:  `Lab-Password3`

+   Choose the  Services  menu, and choose  EC2 . 

+   In the navigation pane on the left, choose  Instances . 
    +   An EC2 instance is listed. As an Amazon EC2 Administrator, this user should have permissions to  Stop  the EC2 instance. 
    +   If you cannot see an EC2 instance, then your Region might be incorrect. In the upper-right corner of the page, choose the Region name, and then choose the Region that you were in at the beginning of the lab (for example,  N. Virginia ). 

+   Select the EC2 instance. 

+   Choose the  Instance state  menu, and then choose  Stop instance . 

+   To confirm that you want to stop the instance, choose  Stop . 

    This time, the action is successful because  user-3  has permissions to stop EC2 instances. The  Instance state  changes to  Stopping  and starts to shut down. 

+   Close your private browser window.
