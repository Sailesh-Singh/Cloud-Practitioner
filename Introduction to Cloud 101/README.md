### Definition Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is the on demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Deploying to the cloud

As cloud computing has grown in popularity, several different models and deployment strategies have emerged to help meet specific needs of different users. Each type of cloud service and deployment method provides you with different levels of control, flexiblity and management. 


[<img src="Deploying_to_the_cloud.png" alt="Deploying to the cloud" width="100%" height="100%" >]()

Understanding the differences between deployment models, and which deployment strategies you can use helps you decide which set of services is right for your needs.

### Cloud Computing models
Cloud computing is offered in three different service models and each one satisfies a unique set of bussiness requirements. Those three models known as:
+   #### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
    IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers(Virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a servive provides the highest levl of flexibility and management cinrol over your IT resources.

+   #### Platform as a service (Paas)
    It removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure. They can focus on the deployment and management of applications. These tools give developers the ability to be more efficient because they dont need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planing, software maintenance, and patching.

+   #### Software as a service(Saas)
    It is a completed software product that the service provider runs and manages. With a SaaS offering, you donot have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. Yu only must think about how you wil use that particular piece of software.

### Cloud Computing deployment models
Choice of deployment model depends on your desired infrastructure, data storage needs, and access requirements. Your unique business requirement will help guide the type of cloud deployment model that you choose.

+   #### Cloud
    You can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new application in the cloud. You can build hose application on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them. Alternatively, you can build them by using higher-level services tha reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.
+   #### Hybrid
    In this, cloud-based resources are conneced to on-premises infrastructure. You can integrate cloud-based resources wih legacy IT application. You migh want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy appliacations that are better maintained on premises, or goverment regulations require your bussiness o keep certain records on premises.
+   #### On-Premises
    It is also known as private cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virualization and resource management tools, Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualizatuon technologies.

### AWS is the leader in cloud computing

<p align="center">
 <img src="AWS_leader_in _cloud-computing.png" alt="Introduction to AWS" width="500px" height="500px" >
  <p align="center"><b><i>Leader board of cloud computing</i></b></p>
 </p>

 AWS has consistently been the leader in cloud infrastructure. Since 2010, AWS has been evaluated as the leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for cloud Infrastructure and platform services. Among the top cloud vendors. AWS has placed highest in both axes of measurement: <i><b>Ability to Execute and Completeness of vison</b></i>

### AWS Global Infrastructure

[<img src="AWS_Global_infrastructure.png" alt="AWS Global Infrastructure" width="100%" height="100%" >](https://awseducate.instructure.com/courses/746/pages/introduction-to-aws?module_item_id=13376)

[<img src="AWS_Global_Infrastructure_Img.png" alt="AWS Global Infrastructure Image" width="100%" height="100%" >](https://awseducate.instructure.com/courses/746/pages/introduction-to-aws?module_item_id=13376)


The main components of the AWS Global Infrastructure are <b>_Regions, Availability zones, and edge locations_</b> that are available in North America.
+   <b>Region</b>
    +   AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where data centers are clustered together.
    +   Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically seprate Availability Zones within a geographic area.
+   <b>Availability Zone</b>
    +   A group of logical data centers is called an Availability Zone.
    +   An Availabilty Zone is a zoned area within a Region that can harbor one or more data centers. Availability Zones house all the hardware devices that AWS offers.
    +   With their own power infrastructure, the Availability Zones are physically seperated by ameaningful distance (up to 100km or 60 miles) fromany other Availability Zone in the Region.
    +   Availability Zones are interconnected with high bandwidth, low-latency networking, to provide low-latency networking between zones that is sufficient to accomplish synchronous replication (same time replication)
+   <b>Edge Location</b>
    +    Edge locations are connected are connected to the AWS Regions through the AWS network across the globe. They link with tens of thousands of networks for improved origin fetches and dynamic content acceleration.
    +   AWS has over 200 edge locations that are placed in 90 cities, across 47 countries.

### Planning for failure
When building the architecture in the cloud. It is important to plan for the failure. When you build your architecture, you want to have a plan in place to resolve any failures that might occur.


+   #####   Storage

    <img src="Planning_for_failure-1.png" alt="Planning_for_failure-1"  border="2px" width="300px" height="80px" >

    When a file is stored in Amazon S3,the file is redundantly copied into every Availability Zone in that Region. If one Availability Zone goes down, you still have two copies of that file available for you to use.

+   #####   Compute

    <img src="Planning_for_failure-2.png" alt="Planning_for_failure-2"  border="2px" width="300px" height="80px" >

    It is a best practice to spread out your computing resources across multiple Availability Zones to gurantee high availability. So, if one Availability Zone goes down, your architecture is still up and running.

+   #####   Database

    <img src="Planning_for_failure-3.png" alt="Planning_for_failure-3"  border="2px" width="300px" height="80px" >

    You can configure your database for Multi-AZ deployment. If your Availability Zone with your primary database fails, one of the standby databases in a healthy Availability Zone automatically becomes your new primary database. Therefore, your architecture is still functioning.
