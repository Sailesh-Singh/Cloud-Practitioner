### Definition Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is the on demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

<tr>
    <th> On demand delivery </th>

    <th> Pay-as-you-go pricing </th>

### Deploying to the cloud

As cloud computing has grown in popularity, several different models and deployment strategies have emerged to help meet specific needs of different users. Each type of cloud service and deployment method provides you with different levels of control, flexiblity and management. 


[<img src="Deploying_to_the_cloud.png" alt="Deploying to the cloud" width="100%" height="100%" >]()

Understanding the differences between deployment models, and which deployment strategies you can use helps you decide which set of services is right for your needs.

### Cloud Computing models
Cloud computing is offered in three different service models and each one satisfies a unique set of bussiness requirements. Those three models known as:
+   #### Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
    IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers(Virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a servive provides the highest levl of flexibility and management cinrol over your IT resources.

+   #### Platform as a service (Paas)
    It removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure. They can focus on the deployment and management of applications. These tools give developers the ability to be more efficient because they dont need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planing, software maintenance, and patching.

+   #### Software as a service(Saas)
    It is a completed software product that the service provider runs and manages. With a SaaS offering, you donot have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. Yu only must think about how you wil use that particular piece of software.

### Cloud Computing deployment models
Choice of deployment model depends on your desired infrastructure, data storage needs, and access requirements. Your unique business requirement will help guide the type of cloud deployment model that you choose.

+   #### Cloud
    You can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new application in the cloud. You can build hose application on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them. Alternatively, you can build them by using higher-level services tha reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.
+   #### Hybrid
    In this, cloud-based resources are conneced to on-premises infrastructure. You can integrate cloud-based resources wih legacy IT application. You migh want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy appliacations that are better maintained on premises, or goverment regulations require your bussiness o keep certain records on premises.
+   #### On-Premises
    It is also known as private cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virualization and resource management tools, Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualizatuon technologies.
