### Definition Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is the on demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

<table>
<tr>
    <th> On demand delivery </th>
    <th> IT resource over the internet </th>
    <th> Pay-as-you-go pricing </th>
</tr>
<tr>
</tr>

     </p>

>   _On demand delivery means a cloud provider has the resources you need, when you need them._

### Client-Server Model
Modern computing is based on the client-server model.

<tr>
<td>

A __client__ can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers.
