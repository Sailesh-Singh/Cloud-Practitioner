### Six benefits of cloud computing

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/sixbenefits.PNG" alt="IT resource over the internet"  width="50%" height="50%" >

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <small>
      <b><i>Benefits of cloud computing</i></b>
    </small>
</p>
</p>

####   1.  Trade upfront expense for variable expense  
<!--- 
[<img src="assets/benefits_1.png" alt="Benefits of cloud computing" width="100%" height="100%" ><small>**_Trade upfront expense for variable expense_**</small>]()-->

Upfront expense refers to data centers, physical servers, and other resources that you would need to invest in before using them. Variable expense means that you pay only for computing resources that you consume. You don't need to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you're going to use them.
By taking a cloud computing approach that offers the benefit of variable expense, companies can implement innovative solutions while saving on costs.

####   2.  Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers

<!--- 
[<img src="assets/benefits_2.png" alt="Benefits of cloud computing" width="100%" height="100%" ><small>**_Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers_**</small>]()-->

Computing in data centers often requires you to spend more money and time managing infrastructure and servers. A benefit of cloud computing is the ability to focus less on these tasks and more on your applications and customers.

####   3.  Stop guessing capacity

<!--- 
[<img src="assets/benefits_3.png" alt="Benefits of cloud computing" width="100%" height="100%" ><small>**_Stop guessing capacity_**</small>]()-->

With cloud computing, you don't have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need before deploying an application.
For example, you can launch Amazon EC2 instances when needed, and pay only for the compute time that you use. You can also scale in or scale out in response to demand.

####   4.  Benefit from massive economics of scale

<!--- 
[<img src="assets/benefits_4.png" alt="Benefits of cloud computing" width="100%" height="100%" ><small>**_Benefit from massive economics of scale_**</small>]()-->

By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower varuable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers can aggregate in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economics of scale.


####   5.  Increase speed and agility

<!--- 
[<img src="assets/benefits_5.png" alt="Benefits of cloud computing" width="100%" height="100%" ><small>**_Increase speed and agility_**</small>]()-->

The flexiblity of cloud computing makes it easier for you to develop and deploy applications. This flexibility provides you with more time to experiment and innovate. When computing in data centers, it might take weeks to obtain new resources that you need. By comparison, you can use cloud computing to access new resources within minutes.

####   6.  Go global in minutes

<!--- 
[<img src="assets/benefits_6.png" alt="Benefits of cloud computing" width="100%" height="100%" ><small>**_Go global in minutes_**</small>]()-->

You can use the global footprint of the AWS Cloud to deploy applications to customers around the world quickly, while providing them with low latency. Therefore, even if you are located in a different part of the world from yours customers, the customers can access your applications with minimal delays.
Later in this course, you will explore the AWS Global Infrastructure in greater detail.

### Deploying to the cloud

As cloud computing has grown in popularity, several different models and deployment strategies have emerged to help meet specific needs of different users. Each type of cloud service and deployment method provides you with different levels of control, flexiblity and management. 


[<img src="assets/Deploying_to_the_cloud.png" alt="Deploying to the cloud" width="100%" height="100%" >]()

Understanding the differences between deployment models, and which deployment strategies you can use helps you decide which set of services is right for your needs.

### Cloud Computing models
Cloud computing is offered in three different service models and each one satisfies a unique set of bussiness requirements. Those three models known as:
+   #### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers(Virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a servive provides the highest levl of flexibility and management cinrol over your IT resources.

+   #### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    It removes the need for organizations to manage the underlying infrastructure. They can focus on the deployment and management of applications. These tools give developers the ability to be more efficient because they dont need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planing, software maintenance, and patching.

+   #### Software as a Service(SaaS)
    It is a completed software product that the service provider runs and manages. With a SaaS offering, you donot have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. Yu only must think about how you wil use that particular piece of software.

### Cloud Computing deployment models
Choice of deployment model depends on your desired infrastructure, data storage needs, and access requirements. Your unique business requirement will help guide the type of cloud deployment model that you choose.

+   #### Cloud
    You can migrate existing applications to the cloud, or you can design and build new application in the cloud. You can build hose application on low-level infrastructure that requires your IT staff to manage them. Alternatively, you can build them by using higher-level services tha reduce the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of the core infrastructure.
+   #### Hybrid
    In this, cloud-based resources are conneced to on-premises infrastructure. You can integrate cloud-based resources wih legacy IT application. You migh want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy appliacations that are better maintained on premises, or goverment regulations require your bussiness o keep certain records on premises.
+   #### On-Premises
    It is also known as private cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virualization and resource management tools, Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualizatuon technologies.

### AWS is the leader in cloud computing

<p align="center">
 <img src="assets/AWS_leader_in _cloud-computing.png" alt="Introduction to AWS" width="500px" height="500px" >
  <p align="center"><b><i>Leader board of cloud computing</i></b></p>
 </p>

 AWS has consistently been the leader in cloud infrastructure. Since 2010, AWS has been evaluated as the leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for cloud Infrastructure and platform services. Among the top cloud vendors. AWS has placed highest in both axes of measurement: <i><b>Ability to Execute and Completeness of vison</b></i>


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58818777/233159240-2c3ca444-3172-4473-a5c8-a420ebeab934.mp4


### AWS Global Infrastructure

[<img src="assets/AWS_Global_infrastructure.png" alt="AWS Global Infrastructure" width="100%" height="100%" >](https://awseducate.instructure.com/courses/746/pages/introduction-to-aws?module_item_id=13376)

[<img src="assets/AWS_Global_Infrastructure_Img.png" alt="AWS Global Infrastructure Image" width="100%" height="100%" >](https://awseducate.instructure.com/courses/746/pages/introduction-to-aws?module_item_id=13376)


The main components of the AWS Global Infrastructure are <b>_Regions, Availability zones, and edge locations_</b> that are available in North America.
+   <b>Region</b>
    +   AWS has the concept of a Region, which is a physical location around the world where data centers are clustered together.
    +   Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated, and physically seprate Availability Zones within a geographic area.
+   <b>Availability Zone</b>
    +   A group of logical data centers is called an Availability Zone.
    +   An Availabilty Zone is a zoned area within a Region that can harbor one or more data centers. Availability Zones house all the hardware devices that AWS offers.
    +   With their own power infrastructure, the Availability Zones are physically seperated by ameaningful distance (up to 100km or 60 miles) fromany other Availability Zone in the Region.
    +   Availability Zones are interconnected with high bandwidth, low-latency networking, to provide low-latency networking between zones that is sufficient to accomplish synchronous replication (same time replication)
+   <b>Edge Location</b>
    +    Edge locations are connected are connected to the AWS Regions through the AWS network across the globe. They link with tens of thousands of networks for improved origin fetches and dynamic content acceleration.
    +   AWS has over 200 edge locations that are placed in 90 cities, across 47 countries.

### Planning for failure
When building the architecture in the cloud. It is important to plan for the failure. When you build your architecture, you want to have a plan in place to resolve any failures that might occur.


+   #####   Storage

    <img src="assets/Planning_for_failure-1.png" alt="Planning_for_failure-1"  border="2px" width="300px" height="80px" >

    When a file is stored in Amazon S3,the file is redundantly copied into every Availability Zone in that Region. If one Availability Zone goes down, you still have two copies of that file available for you to use.

+   #####   Compute

    <img src="assets/Planning_for_failure-2.png" alt="Planning_for_failure-2"  border="2px" width="300px" height="80px" >

    It is a best practice to spread out your computing resources across multiple Availability Zones to gurantee high availability. So, if one Availability Zone goes down, your architecture is still up and running.

+   #####   Database

    <img src="assets/Planning_for_failure-3.png" alt="Planning_for_failure-3"  border="2px" width="300px" height="80px" >

    You can configure your database for Multi-AZ deployment. If your Availability Zone with your primary database fails, one of the standby databases in a healthy Availability Zone automatically becomes your new primary database. Therefore, your architecture is still functioning.

### AWS Regions

[<img src="assets/AWS_Regions.png" alt="AWS Regions" width="100%" height="100%" >]()

In addition to planning for failure at a Regional level with the AWS global infrastructure. You can plan for failure at global level.

<p>
<img src="assets/bulb.png" alt="Bulb" 
align="left" width="50px" height="50px" >

>   For Example, suppose that your production architecture is located in the Northern Virginia Region. You can have a backup that mirrors your production architecture at a lower scale in the Oregon Region or any Region around the world.
</p>

All that you would have to do is scale up your resources in the backup Region. We will learn more about disaster recovery as you dive deeper into AWS.

### Shared Responsiblity

The AWS Shared Responsiblity model is a security model that is used to protect cloud environments that use AWS services. It is divided into two parts:

<b> 1.  The customer is responsible for the security in the cloud.<br>2.   AWS is Responsible for the security of the cloud and </b>

[<img src="assets/Shared_Responsiblity.png" alt="Shared_Responsiblity.png" width="100%" height="100%" >]()

####  Customers 

<img src="assets/Compute_Storage_Networking.png" alt="Compute_Storage_Networking" align="right" width="110px" height="110px" >

Customers are responsible for the security of everything that they create and put __IN__ the AWS Cloud.

+   When uing AWS services, you, the customer, maintain complete control over your content. You are responsible for managing security requirements for your content. These requirements include which content you choosw to store on AWS, which AWS services you use, and who has access to that content. You also control how access rights are granted, managed, and revoked.

####  AWS Cloud

<img src="assets/AWS_Cloud.png" alt="AWS_Cloud.png" align="right" width="120px" height="110px" >

AWS manages the security __OF__ the cloud, specifically the physical infrastructure that hosts your resources, which include:

+   Physical security of data centers
+   Hardware and software infrastructure
+   Network infrastructure
+   Virtualization infrastructure


[<img src="assets/Shared_Responsiblity_instance.png" alt="Shared_Responsiblity_instance.png" width="100%" height="100%" >]()

As an example, suppose that you create a bucket by using __Amazon S3__ to store files in. Then we, *the customer are responsible for security in the cloud*.

+   We are responsible for granting access permissions to users and 
+   Applying any encryption requirement to the buckets and files.

*AWS is responsible for security OF the cloud*. This responsibility includes:
+   Maintaining the storage hardware that the file is hosted on and
+   The physical security of the data centers where the hardware is located.

## Module 4: AWS Core Services 

[<img src="assets/AWS Core Services.png" alt="AWS Core Services" width="100%" height="100%" >](https://awseducate.instructure.com/courses/746/pages/aws-core-services?module_item_id=13191)

### Objectives

AWS offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, security and enterprise applications. These services help you build elastic, agile, resilient architectures. You will be able to:

+   Define the different types of services
+   Identify the main categories of services as part of an architecture
+   Describe each service, its use, features, and benefits

### Monolithic architecture

<img src="assets/Monolithic_architecture.png" alt="Monolithic_architecture"  width="200px" height="110px" >

Applications are made up of multiple components. The components communicate with each other to transmit data, fulfill requests, and keep the application running.

<img src="assets/Monolithic_architecture_instance.png" alt="Monolithic_architecture_instance"  width="200px" height="110px" >

Suppose that you have an application with tightly coupled components. These components might include servers, databases, the user interface, business logic, and others. This type of architecture can be considered a __monolithic application__.

<table>
<tr>
<td>

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/Monolithic_architecture_instance_fails.png" alt="Monolithic_architecture_instance_fails"  width="200px" height="110px" >
</p>

In this approach to application architecture, if a single component fails, then other component likely fail.

</td>
<td>

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/Monolithic_architecture_instance_stopped.png" alt="Monolithic_architecture_instance_stopped"  width="200px" height="120px" >
</p>

In this event, it is even possible that the entire application will fail.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

### Microservices architecture

<img src="assets/Microservices_architecture.png" alt="Microservices_architecture"  align="right" width="30%" height="40%" >

To help maintain application availability when a single components fails, you can design your application through a microservices approach. The loose compiling prevents the entire application from failing. When designing application on AWS. You can take a microservices approach with services and components that fulfill different functions.

### Types of Services

There are three types of services provided by AWS:

#####   1.  Managed Services

<img src="assets/AWS_Types_of_services-Managed-services.png " alt="AWS_Types_of_services-Managed-services"  width="200px" height="110px">

A managed service is a way to describe the services that require you to manage infrastructure management tasks like patching, backup, and repair. These services grant you virtual access to the underlying operating system and servers. With managed services, you are responsible for scaling and building for high availability.

#####   2.  Fully Managed Services

<img src="assets/AWS_Types_of_services-Fully-Managed-services.png " alt="AWS_Types_of_services-Fully-Managed-services"  width="200px" height="110px">

A Full managed service is a way to describe the services that automate infrastructure management tasks that AWS handles, like patching, backup, and repair. These services do not grant you any virtual access to the underlying operating system or servers. With a fully managed service, you are still responsible for scaling and building for high availability.

#####   3.  Serverless Services

<img src="assets/AWS_Types_of_services-Serverless-services.png" alt="AWS_Types_of_services-Serverless-services"  width="200px" height="110px">

Serverless is a way to describe the services, practices, and strategies that you can use to build more agile applications. In this way, you can innovate and respond to change faster. With serverless services, AWS handles infrastructure management tasks like capacity provisoning and patching so that you can focus on building applications that serve your customers. Serverless services come with automatic scaling, built-in high availability, and a pay-for-value billing model.

### AWS Core Service Architecture

[<img src="assets/AWS_Core_Services_Arcitecture-Diagram.png" alt="AWS Core Services Architecture" width="100%" height="100%" >]()

The detailed description of Core Service Architecture are as follows:
####    Identity and Access Management (IAM)

+   #####   What does IAM do?
    IAM is a centralized security management system that is included in every AWS account to control identity access to AWS services. By attaching IAM permission policies to identities, you can manage which services each identity can access and the kinf of actions the identity can perform.
    Identities in IAM are users, groups and roles.

    <br><b>User</b>
    An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS. The IAM user represents the person or services who uses the IAM user to interact with AWS.<br>
    <b>Group</b>
    An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. You can use user groups to specify permissions for a collection of users, which can make those permissions easier to manage for those users.<br>
    <b>Role</b>
    An IAM role is an identity with permission policies that are attached to it. An IAM user or service can assume these policies to temporarily take on different permissions for a specific task.

+   #####   What problem does IAM solve?

    IAM solves the problem of users having more access than they should. IAM is built by using the principle of least privilege. This principle states that an identity will not have access to any AWS services until you grant the identity access. By this method, no one should be able to provison or access resources that you have not explicitly granted them access to.<br>
    For example, if you create a new user, then that user cannot access the EC2 Dashboard by default. You must attach an IAM policy to that user to grant them access to the EC2 Dashboard.

+   #####   What are the benefits of IAM?

    +   IAM has a simple user interface that makes it easy to gran and control user access to AWS services.
    +   IAM has many system-generated policies that you can use, and you create additional custom policies that meet the needs of your specific requirements.

+   #####   How can I architect a cloud solution using IAM ?
    Using IAM roles, you can grant someone from a different AWS account access to your account to perform a specific task.

    <p align="center">
    <img src="assets/Architect_cloud_solution_using-IAM .png" alt="Architect_cloud_solution_using-IAM" width="250px" height="150px" >
    </p>

    In the diagram, a user in the Dev account is assuming a role in the production account. The role returns a temproary security credential. It grants the user temproary access to the AWS service based on the policy that is attached to the role.

+   #####   How can I use IAM ?
    +   ######  Fine-grained access control

        Your users can use IAM to control access to AWS service APIs and to specific resources. You can use IAM to add specific conditions for how a user can use AWS resources or their originating IP address. These conditions might also determine whether they are using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or whether they  have authenticated with a multi-factor authentication device.

    +   ###### Multi-factor authentication
        
        With IAM, you can protect your AWS environment by using AWS multi-factor authentication (MFA).  MFA is a security feature available at no extra cost that augments user name and password credentials. MFA requires users to prove physical possession of a hardware MFA token or MFA-enabled mobile device by providing a valid MFA code.

    +   ###### Analyze access

        IAM helps you analyze access across your AWS environment. Your security teams and administrators can quickly validate that your policies only provide the intended public and cross-account access to your resources. You can also easily identify and refine your policies to allow access to only the services that are being used. This practice helps you to better adhere to the principle of least privilege.

    +   ###### Integrate with your corporate directory
        
        IAM can be used to grant your employees and applications federated access to the AWS Management Console and AWS service APIs. It uses your existing identity systems, such as Microsoft Active Directory. You can use any identity management solution that supports Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0. You can also feel free to use one of the AWS federation samples, such as AWS Management Console single sign-on (SSO) or API federation.


+   #####   What else should I keep in mind when using IAM?
    AWS evaluates policies depends on the types of policies that apply.
    +   ######  Implicit deny
        
        An implict deny denies a user, group, or role access to a service. This policy is the default setting for all new identities when they are created. For the identity to gain access to a service, an explict allow IAM policy must be attached to the identity. The explict allow will then override the implict deny.
        
    +   ###### Explicit allow
        
        An explict allow will override an implict deny. The explict allow can grant full access or partial access, depending on the IAM policy that you attach.
        For example, suppose that you attach an IAM policy to a user explicitly granting them access to read objects in Amazon S3. Then, the implicit deny will still restrict the user from editing or deleting the file. This restriction occurs because, in this example, the user has explicit permissions to only read the file.

    +   ###### Explicit deny

        An explict deny is an IAM policy that you attach to a user, group, or role. It restricts that identify from having access to the service or to specified actions within the service. An explict deny is similar to an implicit deny, with one important distinction: _an explict allow cannot override an explicit deny_ .
        For example, suppose that a user has an explicit allow to full access to Amazon S3. The user is then put into a group that has an explicit deny to delete files from Amazon S3. The result is that has the user will have full access in everything Amazon S3, with the exception of the ability to delete files.

+   #####   How much does IAM cost?
    IAM is a service in your AWS accoun that is offereed at no additional charge. You are charged only when you access other AWS Services by using your IAM users credentials.

####    Amazon Simple Storage Service - S3

+   #####   What does Amazon S3 do?

    Amazon S3 is object storage that is built to store and retrieve any amount  of data from any where at any time. It's a simple storage service that offers industry-leading durability, availability, performance, security, and virtually unlimited scalability at low costs.

+   ##### What problem does Amazon S3 solve?

    Amazon S3 solves two main problems:
    1.  You don't need to estimate how much storage space you will need. You create your bucket and add as many files as you need to. Amazon S3 is elastic and scales automatically to meet your storage requirements.

    2.  Files that are uploaded to Amazon S3 are automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in the Region. Thus, your files are always highly available and highly durable, so that you can access them when you need them.

+   #####   What are the benefits of Amazon S3?

    The following list describes a few of the benefits that Amazon S3 offers.

    +   Amazon S3 offers you industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, and durability that you can use to easily build applications that use cloud native storage. As a result, you consistently have your data when you need it.<br>

    +   ######  Archive
        Retire physical infrastructure, and archive data with Amazon Simple Storage Service Glacier and S3 Glacier Deep Archive. These S3 storage classes retain objects long-term at the lowest rates. You create an S3 Lifecycyle policy to archive objects throughout their lifecycles, or upload objects directly to the archival storage classes.

    +   ######  Data lakes and big data analytics

        Accelerate innovation by building a data lake on Amazon S3, and extract valuable insights by using query-in-place, analytics, and machine learning tools. As your data lake grows, use S3 Access Points to easily configure access to your data, with specific permissions for each application or set of applications.

+   #####   What else should I keep in mind when using Amazon S3?

    Amazon S3 is designed for object storage, not block storage.

    __Object storage__ is a storage option that is meant for read-intensive files that are not written to. If the file needs a change, then the file can be overwritten. Examples of object storage are pictures, videos, documents, and static websites.
    <br>

    __Block storage__ is a more structured set of data hosting that is often written to. Examples of object storage are pictures, videos, documents, and static websites. Amazon S3 is not designed for these uses. Amazon offers Amazon Elastic Block Store to meet these needs.

+   #####   How much does Amazon S3 cost?

With Amazon S3, you pay only for what you use. It has no minimum fee. Some prices vary across Amazon S3 Regions. Billing prices are based on the location of your S3 bucket.

####    AWS Lambda

+   #####   What does AWS Lambda do?

    AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that you can use to run function code without provisoning or managing servers. You can use Lambda torun function code  for virtually any type of application or backend service. You upload your code, and Lambda takes care of everything that is required to run and scale your code with high availability.

+   #####   What problem does AWS Lambda solve?
    AWS lambda removes all administration for application or backend services that can be processed in snippets of code. You upload your code as a `.zip` file or container image. Then, Lambda automatically and precisely allocates compute power to run your code based on the incoming request or event, for any scale of traffic, You can set up your code to automatically trigger from over 200 services and software as a service (SaaS) applications or call it directly from any web or mobile app.


+   #####   What are the benefits of AWS Lambda?

    The following list describes the main benfits that AWS Lambda offers.

    +   AWS Lambda is serverless, so you have no servers to manage. Lambda automatically runs your code without requiring you to provision or manage infrastructure. You write the code and upload it to Lambda either as a `.zip` file or as a container image.

    +   AWS Lambda has built in continuous scaling that scales your applicatio by running  code in response to each event. It scales precisely with the size of the workload, from a few requests per day to hundreds of thousands per second.

+   #####   How can I architect a cloud solution using AWS Lambda?

    You can architect with Lambda by configuring Lambda to perform an action when an event occurs in a triggering service.

    <br>
     <p align="center">
    <img src="assets/Architect_with_Lambda_by_configuring_Lambda.png " alt="Architect_with_Lambda_by_configuring_Lambda">
    </p>
    <br>

    In this example, a user uploads a photo into Amazon S3 - Bucket A. This action triggers the Lambda code to run and resize the photo and place the photo in Amazon S3 - Bucket B. From Bucket B, the user can download the resized photo. Lambda then sends an email or a text message to the appropriate users to alert them that the photo is ready to download.

+   #####   How can I use AWS Lambda?

    +   ######  Web applications
        By combining AWS Lambda with other AWS services, developers can build powerful web applications that automatically scale up and down. These applications run in a highly available configuration across multiple data centers - with zero administrative effort required for scalability, backups, or multi-data redundancy.

    +   ######  Data processing
        You can use AWS Lambda to execute code in response to triggers such as changes in data, shifts in system state, or action by users. Lambda can be directly triggered by AWS services such as Amazon S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, Amazon SNS, and CloudWatch, or it can be orchestrated into workflows by AWS Step Functions. Thus, you can build a variettty of real-time serverless data processing systems.

    +   ######  Real-time file processing

        You can use Amazon S3 to trigger AWS Lambda to process data immediately after an upload. You can also connect to an existing Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system directly, which enables massively parallel shared access for large-scale file processing. For example, you can use Lambda to thumbnail images, transcode videos, index files, process logs, validate content, and aggregate and filter data in real-time.

    +   ######  Real-time stream processing
        You can use AWS Lambda and Amazon Kinesis to process real-time streaming data for application activity tracking, transaction order processing, and click stream  analysis. You can also use it for data cleansing, metrics generation, log filtering, indexing, social media analysis, and Internet of Things (IoT) device data telemetry and metering.

+   #####   What else should I keep in mind when using AWS Lambda?

    AWS Lambda has a 15-minute limit on its runtime for each invocation. If your computing needs require more than 15 minutes for runtime, then you would need to use an EC2 instance instead of Lambda.

+   #####   How much does AWS Lambda cost?

    With AWS Lambda, you pay only for what you use. You are charged based on the number of requests for your Lambda functions and the duration, the time it takes for you code to run.
    The AWS Lambda always free usage tier includes 1 M free requests per month and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.

    No charge is incurred when your code is not running.


#### Amazon DynamoDB

+   #####   What else should I keep in mind when using DynamoDB ?

    DynamoDB is a non-relational database. If you need a relational database, you would use Amazon RDS.

    +   ######  Relational Database
        __Relational databases__ store data in rows and columns. Rows contain all the information about one entry, and columns are the attributes that seperate the data points. A relational database schema is fixed: columns must be locked before data entry. You can amend schemas if the database is altered entirely and taken offline. Data in relational databases is queried by using structured query language (SQL), which can have complex queries.
        Relational databases scale vertically by increasing hardware power. Relational databases are commonly used for traditional applications, enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer releationship management (CRM), and e-commerce.

    +   ######  Non-Relational database
        __Non-relational databases__ store data by using one of many storage models, including key-value pairs, documents, and graphs. Non-relational schemas are dynamic, and information can be added rapidly. Each <i>row</i> doesn't have to contain data for each <i>column</i>. Data in non-releational databases is queried by focousing on collections of documents. Non-releational databases scale horizontally by increasing servers. Key-value databases are commonly used for internet-scale applications, real-time bidding, shopping carts, and customer preferences.

+   #####   How much does DynamoDB cost ?

    DynammoDB charges for reading, writing, and storing data in your DynamoDB tables, along with any optional features you choose to enable. DynamoDB has two capacity modes (on-demand and provisoned), both of which come with specific billing options for processing reads and writes on your tables.

####    Amazon Virtual Private Cloud - VPC

+   #####   What does Amazon VPC do ?

    Amazon VPC is a service that you use to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual nework that you define. As a foundational AWS services, Amazon VPC makes it easy to customize your VPC's network configuration. You can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that have access to the internet. You can also use Amazon VPC to place your backend systems, such as daabases or applicatuon servers, in a private-facing subnet with no internet access. With Amazon VPC, you can use multiple layers of security to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet. These layers include security groups and nework access control lists(network ACLs).

+   #####   What problem does Amazon VPC solve ?

    Amazon VPC provides features that you can use to increase and monitor the security for your virtual private clou (VPC) on demand. Therefore, you can create a data center as you need it and terminate it when you no longer need it.

+   #####   What are the benefits of Amazon VPC ?

    The following list describes a few of the benefits that Amazon VPC offers.

    +   Amazon VPC provides advanced security features that you can use to perform inbound and outbound filtering at the instance and subnet levels.

You can also use a VPC to add more compute capacity to your network by connecting your VPC can be hosted behind your corporate firewall, you can seamlessly move your IT resources into the cloud. You don't need to change how your users access these applications.

+   #####   What else should I keep in mind when using Amazon VPC?

    When you creae a new Amazon VPC, you can have the option to create one by using a template or create one from scratch.
    
    When you create one from scratch, auomatically it will create a route table, a network ACL, and a security group. Then you configure them according to your needs.
    
    If you must delete a VPC, be sure to first terminate any EC2 or RDS instances that you have provisioned in the VPC.

+   #####   How much does Amazon VPC cost?
    An Amazon VPC doesn't cost you anything at a basic level. In fact, when you set up your AWS account, you are given a default VPC. A VPC consists of many components that do not cost you anything, such as subnets, route tables, network ACLs, security groups, and an internet gateway.
    <br>

    However, you can also add features toyour Amazon VPC such as a NAT gateway and elastic IPs that do have associated charges.
    <br>

    Also, any service that you place in your Amazon VPC, such as Amazon EC2, will carry with it the associated cost for that service.
    <br>

####    Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2 : Public Subnet

    <br>

+   #####   How can I use Amazon EC2 ?

    +   ###### Host multi-tier applications

        Amazon EC2 can be used to create multi-tier web applications. With security groups, you control the kind of port traffic that can reach your instances. You configure your security group and attach it to your instances, and you control the traffic that can enter each layer of your architecture.

    +   ######  Backup and disaster recovery

        With Amazon EC2, you can create a backup instance if your main instances fail. In the event of a failure, you can scale up your backup instances until you get your main instances back online. Then, scale your backup instances back down when recovery of your main instances is complete. Amazon EC2 instances can act as a backup for cloud or on-premises instances.

    +   ######  On-demand computing

        Amazon EC2 lets you provison instances to perform computing jobs and terminate them when you are done. This arrangement can save you a lot of money. If you only need the computing resource for a few hours, days, or weeks.

    +   ######  Host databases

         AWS offers fully managed and serverless database services that you can provision for all your database needs. However, with both fully managed services and serverless services, you don't have access to the operating system of the database. But you can host your own database on an EC2 instance, if your company requires you to have that access.

+   #####   What else should I keep in mind when using Amazon EC2 ?

    If you stop an instance, the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume that is attached will retain your data. You will still be charged for the use of the volume. However, if you terminate the instance, then all your data on the volume will be permanently deleted. The volume will return to AWS for available use to other customers.

+   #####   How much does Amazon EC2 cost ?
    + ######  On-demand Instances
        
        With On-Demand instances, you pay for instances only for the amount of time that you use them. No long-term commitments or upfront payments are required. You can increase  or decrease your compute capacity depending on the demands of your application and pay only for the time that you use them.
        <b>Use Case</b> : Short-term computing workloads that cannot be interrupted; and users that need low-cost computing without any upfront or long-term commitment.

    + ######  Spot Instances

        You can use Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to take advantage of unused Amazon EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud for a discount. You can save up to 90 percent compared to On-Demand prices. To get a Spot instance, you submit a request with the instance specifications and the maximum price that you are willing to pay per hour. When a Spot Instance is available at your submitted price, you will have access to the instance.

        <b>Use Case</b> : Workloads that can be paused and restarted when computing prices meet your budget for Spot Instances.

    + ######  Reserved Instances

        Reserved Instances provide you with a significant discount (up to 75 percent) compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. With Reserved Instances, you commit to paying for the instance for 1 or 3 years, depending on the conditions you agree to when purchasing them.
        <b>Use Case</b> : Computing needs with a steady amount usage of up to 1 year or more.

####    Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) : Private Subnet
