#   [Getting Started with Databases](https://awseducate.instructure.com/courses/912)

## Overview

The business world is constantly changing and evolving. By accurately recording, updating, and tracking data efficiently and on a regular basis, companies can use the immense potential from the insights that they obtain from their data. Database management systems are the crucial link for managing this data. Like other cloud services, cloud databases offer significant cost advantages over traditional database strategies.

In this module, you learn about database fundamentals and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). Amazon RDS is a managed web service that helps customers create and manage highly scalable and secure relational databases in the AWS Cloud. Customers aren’t responsible for hardware provisioning, database setup, software patching, and backups. AWS manages common database administrative tasks.

Amazon RDS supports most relational database engines, including commercial (such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server [MSSQL]), open source (MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB), and Amazon Aurora. With Amazon RDS, you store and transmit data securely.

In this course, you acquire the knowledge that you need to start using Amazon RDS. You learn about the key elements of Amazon RDS and explore how to configure them. You also learn the basic elements of high availability, backups, and security to set up a database that suits the needs of your workload. 

##  Course Level 

This is a foundational level course that is written for learners beginning with cloud computing and AWS services. When you start this course, you don’t need to have a deep understanding of cloud computing. If you already have a deeper understanding of cloud computing, you might still find this course helpful in refreshing your knowledge and practicing your skills. 

It’s helpful if you already have a basic understanding of cloud computing concepts and the AWS Management Console. AWS Educate supports this background knowledge with the following courses:

+   Introduction to the AWS Management Console
+   Introduction to Cloud 101
